### Data Preparation

I find the data set of each year from 2012 to 2020, all the data set have same columns, through the power query merge all the data set to one data set.

As Punjab province have high crime related to other province becuse of the largest provice of Pakistan in population, also Balochistan province have low crime related to other province due to smallest province in population.

#### *Second Step:*

 * Average crime rate of each province in pakistan per year
 * Indicate the top 5 type of crime in pakistan
 * Average of different type of crime  in each province of pakistan

## Tools & Techniques
 * Tool: Microsoft Power BI
 * Techniques: Data preparation, Aggregation, visualization using interactive Dashboard


### Data Preparation

I find the data set of each year from 2012 to 2020, all the data set have same columns, through the power query merge all the data set to one data set.

After merge the data to one data set, start work on visualisation

#### *First Step:*

First to find the total crime report in each province of pakistan by creating card related to each province

As Punjab province have high crime related to other province becuse of the largest provice of Pakistan in population, also Balochistan province have low crime related to other province due to smallest province in population.

#### *Second Step:*

Visualize the average crime rate per year of each province thorgh line chart

from the line grapgh it shown that the average crime rate in Punjab from 2018 to 2020 immedialtly increases, so the Punjab provincial government should prepare ploicy to stop the crime rate 

#### *Third Step:*

Visualise the top 5 type crime rate through column chart;

After the 9/11 attacks, a large number of people were kidnapped, making abduction one of the biggest issues in Pakistan. Due to the influence of the establishment and the war that followed, kidnappings significantly increased, particularly in the provinces of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) and Balochistan.

#### *Fourth step:*

Visualize the average total of each provice by the type of crime 

 *Punjab*

The donut chart shown that the kidnapping/abducting percentage is high than other because of largest province in population and weak law enforcement.

*Khyber Pakhtunkhwa(KPK)*

After the 9/11 attacks in the USA, the American government decided to take military action in Afghanistan. As a result of the war between the USA and the Afghan Taliban government, Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province was significantly affected. According to the donut chart, the murder rate in KPK is noticeably higher compared to other crimes.

*Sindh*

From donut chart we seen that robbery in Sindh is the biggest problem due to social inequality and lack of enducation in that province
